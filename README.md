## Data / Corpus

Our corpus consists of recipes for 10 different dishes from the [Microsoft Research Multimodal Aligned Recipe Corpus](https://github.com/microsoft/multimodal-aligned-recipe-corpus). For each dish, there are 11 recipes parsed into action graphs. We provide crowdsourced action alignments between the action phrases of **10 recipe pairings per dish**. These alignments indicate which action from the shorter of two recipes corresponds best to an action from the longer recipe.
