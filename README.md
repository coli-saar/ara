## Data / Corpus

Our corpus consists of recipes for 10 different dishes from the [Microsoft Research Multimodal Aligned Recipe Corpus](https://github.com/microsoft/multimodal-aligned-recipe-corpus). For each dish, there are 11 recipes parsed into action graphs. We provide crowdsourced action alignments between the action phrases of **10 recipe pairings per dish**. These alignments indicate which action from the shorter of two recipes corresponds best to an action from the longer recipe. 

The data folder contains an updated version (ARA 1.1) of the originally created corpus in which part of the within-sentence punctuation was missing. This punctuation was added back in the updated version. For more details on the differences between ARA 1.0 and ARA 1.1 see [here](https://github.com/kastein/ara/blob/main/data/README.md#ara-10-vs-ara-11).
The originally created corpus version is available as Release [ARA 1.10 Corpus](https://github.com/kastein/ara/releases/tag/v1.0).
